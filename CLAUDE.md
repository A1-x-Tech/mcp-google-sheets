# CLAUDE.md — mcp-google-sheets

MCP server for the Google Sheets API v4 (TypeScript, stdio). Mixed read/write:
tools cover spreadsheet search/metadata, range reads and (batch) writes, sheet
management, formatting/dimensions/freeze/borders, data validation, protected
ranges, conditional formats, tables, charts and Drive-based sharing;
`raw_request` is the escape hatch. The server talks to
`https://sheets.googleapis.com` with a Bearer token; the token is minted from an
OAuth2 refresh token via `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` (or a static
`GOOGLE_SHEETS_ACCESS_TOKEN`, mostly for testing). The Drive API v3
(`https://www.googleapis.com`) is an **internal dependency only** — spreadsheet
search and permissions have no Sheets equivalent — and is never reachable from
`raw_request`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # run from source (tsx watch)
npm test           # unit tests + dist smoke, no network
npm run typecheck  # types for src + tests
npm run build      # emit dist/
npm run smoke      # live check: read-only by default; GOOGLE_SHEETS_SMOKE_WRITE=1
                   # runs the disposable create→write→verify→trash cycle
```

## Architecture

- `src/config.ts` — env → config. Credentials: either the refresh triple
  `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET` + `GOOGLE_SHEETS_REFRESH_TOKEN`
  (all three or `ConfigError` `incomplete_oauth_config`) or `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ACCESS_TOKEN`;
  optional `GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_BASE`, `GOOGLE_SHEETS_TIMEOUT_MS`, `GOOGLE_SHEETS_MAX_RETRIES`.
  No credentials at all is NOT an error: the fields stay `undefined` and the server starts
  degraded. Also home to `CredentialsError` / `MISSING_CREDENTIALS_MESSAGE` (opens with the
  historical startup error verbatim, then names the variables and the restart) and
  `hasCredentials()`.
- `src/client.ts` — all HTTP and all wire mapping. Token lifecycle (cache until ~60s before
  expiry, dedupe concurrent refreshes, one forced re-mint + replay on 401); `httpRequest()`
  resolves the path against its base and rejects foreign origins (SSRF guard — `request()`
  is pinned to the Sheets origin, the private `driveRequest()` to the Drive origin),
  enforces an AbortController timeout that also covers reading the body, retries 429 always
  but 5xx/network errors **only for GET** — replaying a write after an ambiguous failure
  would duplicate it — and throws `GoogleSheetsError(status, body)`. Typed per-endpoint
  methods build the batchUpdate requests and computed fields masks; `hexToColor()`,
  `buildCellFormat()`, `buildChartSpec()`, `buildConditionalRule()` map the normalized
  vocabulary (hex colors, snake_case enums, simplified chart params) to the wire shapes.
- `src/tools/spreadsheets.ts` — `create_spreadsheet`, `get_spreadsheet`,
  `search_spreadsheets` (Drive-backed). `src/tools/values.ts` — `read_values`,
  `write_values`, `batch_write_values`, `append_values`, `clear_values`.
  `src/tools/sheets.ts` — `manage_sheets` (add/duplicate/rename/delete/copy_to).
  `src/tools/format.ts` — `format_cells`, `set_frozen`, `set_borders`,
  `manage_dimensions` (resize/auto_resize/insert/delete/hide/show/group/ungroup).
  `src/tools/rules.ts` — `set_data_validation`, `manage_protected_ranges`,
  `manage_conditional_formats`. `src/tools/objects.ts` — `manage_tables`, `manage_charts`.
  `src/tools/sharing.ts` — `manage_permissions` (Drive-backed).
  `src/tools/raw.ts` — `raw_request` (GET/POST/PUT, Sheets origin only).
  `src/tools/util.ts` — `ok`/`fail`, the four annotation presets
  (`READ_ONLY`/`WRITE`/`UPDATE`/`DESTRUCTIVE`) and shared zod schema factories
  (`spreadsheetIdSchema`, `a1RangeSchema`, `sheetIdSchema`, `gridRangeSchema` +
  `toGridRange`, `hexColorSchema`, `valuesSchema`).
- `src/index.ts` — wires every `register*` into the McpServer. `loadConfigOrDegraded()`
  catches `ConfigError`, pings `startup_failed` (fire-and-forget) and degrades the config to
  "no credentials"; an unconfigured start prepends `UNCONFIGURED_PREFIX` — plus
  `Configuration problem: <message>` when a ConfigError was caught — to the initialize
  `instructions`, and `oninitialized` sends `server_start` for a configured install or
  `unconfigured_start` (with the reason) otherwise.
- `src/telemetry.ts` — anonymous usage pings (ids/names/versions only, never data or
  arguments; fire-and-forget, must never block or throw; opt-out `ASKADS_TELEMETRY=0`).
  `server_start` means "a usable install started"; `unconfigured_start` is a degraded start
  and `startup_failed` a malformed config caught at load — both carry a `reason` from a
  closed vocabulary (`missing_credentials`, `incomplete_oauth_config`) — never a variable's
  name or value.
- `src/smoke.ts` — live smoke. Read-only by default (metadata fetch or token mint);
  `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SMOKE_WRITE=1` opts into create → write → read-back-verify → trash on a
  disposable spreadsheet, with cleanup in `finally` (success and failure alike).

## Conventions (do not break)

- **Never exit because of configuration.** A server that dies before the MCP handshake leaves
  the user with a red cross and no reason — telemetry across this line of servers showed that
  state accounted for nearly every unconfigured install, and almost none of them recovered.
  Missing credentials are a survivable state: start, answer initialize (with the unconfigured
  prefix in `instructions`) and tools/list, and let the first tool call fail with
  `CredentialsError` — its message names the variables to set and says to restart, because
  credentials come only from the environment. `config.test.ts`, `client.test.ts` and
  `test/dist-smoke.test.js` pin this.
- **Credential failures are not transport failures.** `CredentialsError` is thrown in
  `accessToken()` before any fetch — before the retry/backoff loop, the token mint and the
  401 replay — because retrying it burns seconds of backoff before the user sees the one
  message that helps. Pinned by the "fetch never called" assertion in `client.test.ts`.
- **Never retry a write on 5xx/network errors.** Only 429 (rejected before executing) and GET
  are safe; the gate lives in `httpRequest()` and is pinned by tests. This covers PUT too —
  `values.update` is nominally idempotent, but an ambiguous failure plus a concurrent editor
  is not a bet worth making, and `append` would flatly duplicate rows.
- **Drive stays internal.** Only `search_spreadsheets`, `manage_permissions` and the smoke
  cleanup touch the Drive API, through the private `driveRequest()`. No generic Drive tool,
  and `raw_request` must keep rejecting Drive paths — the issue scopes this server to Sheets.
- **Wire mapping lives in the client, not the tools.** Tools accept the normalized snake_case
  vocabulary and must not build wire shapes (GridRange keys, fields masks, `{red,green,blue}`
  colors, ChartSpec unions) — add any mapping in `client.ts`. Pass-through of wire enum
  *values* (`ONE_OF_LIST`, `ROWS`, `SOLID`) is fine; building wire *structures* in a tool is
  not.
- **Auth is the client's job.** Tools never see tokens; the Bearer header, refresh, caching
  and the 401 replay all live in `httpRequest()`/`accessToken()`.
- **Two addressing schemes, never mixed.** Values tools take A1 strings; structural tools
  take sheetId + 0-based half-open indexes. Descriptions must keep steering the model to
  `get_spreadsheet` for sheetIds/objectIds/rule indexes before structural mutations.
- **Validate inputs with zod** in `inputSchema`; reuse the shared schema **factories** in
  `util.ts` (a fresh schema per field avoids `$ref` dedup in the JSON schema).
- **Annotations are pinned per tool** in `annotations.test.ts` — changing one is a conscious
  decision that updates the map, with all four hints always set.
- **Output compact JSON via `ok`** — the consumer is an LLM; pretty-printing burns tokens.
  Responses pass through verbatim (describe the fields in the tool `description`, the only
  place the external model reads).

## Adding a tool

Before changing the tool registry, read [the MCP capability documentation contract](docs/CAPABILITY-DOCUMENTATION.md). Every registered tool must have exactly one task-oriented page in `docs/capabilities/`; update that page, the index, and the coverage test in the same change.

1. Add (or extend) `src/tools/<name>.ts` with `register<Name>Tools(server, client)`.
2. If it hits a new endpoint, add a method to `src/client.ts` with the wire mapping.
3. Import and call the register fn in `src/index.ts`.
4. Add a `*.test.ts` using the mock-fetch (client) / fake-client (tools) harness — no
   network — and add the tool + hints to `annotations.test.ts` and `test/dist-smoke.test.js`.
5. Add the capability page and index entry in `docs/capabilities/`, and the row in
   `docs/TOOLS.md`.
6. `npm run typecheck && npm test`.

## Releasing

Keep the version in sync across **all** channels in one go (`git push --follow-tags` pushes
the tag but does **not** create a GitHub Release; the registry is immutable per version):

1. Bump `version` in **three places, identically**: `package.json`, and in `server.json`
   **both** the root `version` **and** `packages[0].version`. `mcpName` in `package.json` must
   match `name` in `server.json` (`io.github.A1-x-Tech/mcp-google-sheets`). Verify:
   `grep -n '"version"' package.json server.json`.
   > ⚠️ `mcp-publisher` publishes the **root** `server.json.version`. A stale root makes
   > `mcp-publisher publish` fail with a misleading `400 cannot publish duplicate version`
   > while `npm publish` succeeds.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, then `npm publish` (runs typecheck + tests + build via
   `prepublishOnly` / `prepare`). The package is scoped — `publishConfig.access: public`
   must stay in `package.json`.
3. `git commit`, `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z`, `git push origin main --follow-tags`.
4. **GitHub Release:** `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title vX.Y.Z --generate-notes --verify-tag`.
5. **Official MCP registry:** `mcp-publisher publish` (login with
   `mcp-publisher login github --token "$(gh auth token)"`).
