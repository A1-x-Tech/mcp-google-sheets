  "('Sheet name'!A1:C10), structural tools (sheets, formatting, rules, tables, charts) take the " +
  "numeric sheetId plus 0-based half-open row/column indexes — call get_spreadsheet first to map " +
  "titles to sheetIds (titles change, sheetIds never do). Read formulas with " +
  "value_render_option=FORMULA; on write, USER_ENTERED (the default) parses '=...' as live formulas " +
  "and numbers/dates per the spreadsheet locale, RAW stores strings literally. Quotas are " +
  "per-minute (300 read + 300 write per project, 60 each per user) and one batch call counts once — " +
  "prefer read_values with several ranges and batch_write_values over per-cell loops; a spreadsheet " +
  "tops out at 10 million cells. Deleting sheets, rows or cleared values has no undo through the " +
  "API, and writes are never retried after a 5xx or timeout — re-read state before re-sending. " +
  "Conditional-format rules are addressed by per-sheet index and shift on every add/delete — " +
